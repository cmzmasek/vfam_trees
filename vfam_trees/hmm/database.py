"""HMM database resolution, indexing, and GA-cutoff parsing.

The database file is a concatenated HMMER3 ``.hmm`` text file (one or
more profiles separated by ``//`` records). ``hmmscan`` requires the
binary indexes ``.h3f / .h3i / .h3m / .h3p`` produced by ``hmmpress``;
this module auto-presses on first use when those are missing.

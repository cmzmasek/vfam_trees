"""Top-level cache-aware batch entry point for hmmscan.

``scan_proteins`` is the single function the marker identifier calls. It:
    1. Resolves and indexes the database (with auto-hmmpress).
    2. Computes a db-signature for cache invalidation.
    3. Dedupes queries by AA sequence (many CDSes share identical AA
       across closely related isolates).
    4. Splits cached vs uncached, batches the uncached set into ONE
       hmmscan call, writes results back to the cache.
    5. Returns ``{query_id: [hit_dict, ...]}``.

``passes_cutoffs`` applies the E-value/GA + relative-length gate so
callers don't need to know the cutoff layout themselves.

Vendored from ``repseq/hmm/runner.py``.  The persistent-cache hook
(``cache``) is kept on the signature but vfam_trees passes ``None`` in
v1 (per-species proteome scans are cheap); the in-run dedup-by-sequence
still applies.

    Ordering rule for multidomain tokens — named domains must appear in

    consecutive pair (Hi, Hi+1) we require:

    * ``Hi.ali_to <= Hi+1.ali_from + overlap_tolerance`` — boundaries may
      overlap by up to ``overlap_tolerance`` residues (default 0 → strict
      non-overlap). The tolerance accommodates Pfam profile boundaries that
      don't quite align to the molecular cleavage site.

      strict forward progression of both endpoints. This rejects full
